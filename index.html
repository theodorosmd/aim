          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p>
            Arameans In Medicine (AIM) stands for peace and unity, will work for
            Arameans worldwide and welcomes you to join this organisation, whether
            you're in the medical field or not.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's dive into the meaning of the name Arameans In Medicine and what
            issues precursed the startup of the organisation. "Medicine" is
            defined as the science of health and healing. The World Health
            Organisation defines health as "a state of complete physical, mental
            and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or
            infirmity." Collaboration and cooperation among various actors,
            organizations, and levels are crucial aspects that run through the
            entire healthcare system.
          </p>
          <p>
            The "Arameans" are indigenous people of The Middle East
            (Mesopotamia), mentioned since over 3000 years ago and the biggest
            semitic ethnic group ever existed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today Arameans are dispersed in a global diaspora due to centuries of
            persecution in their homeland, and due to the world map drawing
            excluding Arameans from the right to their own lands, which they still
            inhabit until today.
          </p>
          <p class="highlight-text">
            The organisation welcomes everyone in the community outside of the
            medical and health care industry to become a benefitting member and
            supporter, no matter occupation.

            <h2>Faith, heritage and vocation (Symbolism)</h2>
            <p class="section-lead">What is the meaning behind the logo?</p>
            <p>
              There are three main features on the logo; The Cross, The eagle and
              the snakes surrounding a staff.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Cross symbolizes the christian mission and morals that lay the
              foundation for this organization as well as the religion of the
              members of the target audience.
            </p>
            <p>
              The eagle is an ancient symbol for strength and drive, found in
              various Aramean sites during different epochs in Mesopotamia.
            </p>
            <p>
              The snakes surrounding the staff is taken from the universal logo
              of medicine which is thought to originate from the Greek god of
              healing Aesculapius.

          <h2>The Need</h2>
          <p class="eyebrow">By Chairman Dr. Aramia Sauma</p>
          <p>
            Our community faces exclusion as a minority group both in the
            diaspora and homeland, posing challenges in accessing timely and
            appropriate care.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the diaspora, crucial public health advice often pass by our
            community unnoticed due to linguistic, cultural and socioeconomic
            barriers, exacerbating our exclusion from healthcare rights and
            public health education.
          </p>
          <p>
            Arameans in Medicine (AIM) aim to address these issues, working to
            bridge the healthcare gap and enhance public health education for our
            community. AIM will also support individuals in healthcare and
            medical fields to advance in their careers.
          </p>
          <p class="quote">
            "I support AIM, despite not working in any medical or health related
            industry, because health concerns us all and it is important to help
            combat the issues faced by our community regarding health care."
